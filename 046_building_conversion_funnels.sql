-- Assignment_Building_Conversion_Funnels

-- Solution is a multi-step query    

-- STEP 1: select all pageviews for relevant sessions
-- STEP 2: identify each pageview as the specific funnel step
-- STEP 3: create the session-level conversion funnel view
-- STEP 4: aggregate the data to assess funnel performance
